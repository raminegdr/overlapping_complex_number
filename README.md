# overlapping_complex_number
This project is a sample of library implementation, objective programming and overlapping for complex number problem.
in this project we could define 26 variable named [a,...,z] and do 3 main operator on two variable.
for example for inserting complex variable x number, you must enter x=4+5j or y=5+3j
after that we can do 3 operator like:

   1. sum +xy
   2.subtraction -xy
   3.multi +xy
